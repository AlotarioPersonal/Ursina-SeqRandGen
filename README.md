3D MAZE GENERATION




Contained in level-data.py is a repository of 2-dimensional levels. They can have three corresponding values in these lists--



0 - Floor

1 - Wall

2 - Random



Used this framework to create a game called Axe Quest. You can find it here: https://brimlessentertainment.itch.io/axe-quest-1994

As far as the random generation goes, right now it's mostly completely random. I don't have a way to index the random 2D data to a list and adjust accordingly to make a fully traversable set of terrain.

You may use this in your projects, I don't care
